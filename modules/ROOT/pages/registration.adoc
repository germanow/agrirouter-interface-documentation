== Overview

To create applications for agrirouter, a developer account is required.

Over the whole process of integration, the developer will have to create 2 accounts:

One account at the productive environment, where the application should be available after certification to be connected for the end user and one account in the "Quality Assurance"-Environment (QA) to test the application during the development process.

The URLs to signup for accounts can be found xref:./urls.adoc[here].

After creating your account, please also send an email to support@my-agrirouter.com to ask for the activation of your account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should only create one developer account per app provider and environment. So, if your company has multiple developers, 1 developer should handle the developer account; the other developers can use end user accounts to test and develop the application.
