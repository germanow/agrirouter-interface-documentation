== General Password policies
For security reasons, a password assigned to an account only stays valid for a period of 6 month.
After that time, the user will be informed when trying to log in for the next time to the agrirouter UI. 

== End-User (Farmers, Contractors, Consultants)

The end-user has access to the graphical user interface of the agrirouter for end users.

The user interface offers possibilities to handle the account:

* onboard new application instances (creating endpoints in their agrirouter account)
* create groups of endpoints
* connect an account with other agrirouter accounts to exchange data
* setup routings to allow or disallow message delivery to specific endpoints or endpoint groups
* create endpoint records for service purpose
* modify his user interface (e.g. color scheme)
* view a list of news/updates for his account (e.g "account connected", "endpoint onboarded", etc.)

== Developer

The developer has access to the graphical user interface of the agrirouter for developerâ€™s users.

A developers account includes an end user account, therefore, the developer account has all functionalities of an end user account.

[NOTE]
====
There is only 1 developer account needed *per company.* Testing the app; especially in the Quality assurance environment can be done from an ordinary end user account.
====

Additionally, developers can manage their own applications:

* Create new applications
* Modify the information for the application like name, description or symbol
* Add new software versions for Certification
* Manage the required capabilities of the application
* Block specific endpoints, e.g. to avoid abuse of applications
* Replay Endpoint Records
* Export metrics of agrirouter usage for billing purpose
