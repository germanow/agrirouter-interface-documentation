= Sending a Request
:imagesdir: _images/

The message or command is sent to the agrirouter using a protocol dependent request to its agrirouter inbox.

== General Prerequisites

=== Routings available

To send a message to another endpoint, there is an existing routing required. This also applies to published messages

[NOTE]
====
New routings might take a few seconds to minutes to be activated.
====


=== Publishing only with available subscriptions

If you publish a message, it will only reach an endpoint if there is at least one subscribed endpoint.

== Using MQTT

The endpoint address of the MQTT broker is delivered as host+port in the onboarding request. The inbox is the topic delivered with the "measures" attribute of the onboarding request.

To send a message, publish it. (Here, publish means the MQTT-Term, see https://mqtt.org) 

In general, the hosts should be as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|======================================================
|Area |Environment |URL
|EU |Quality Assurance |https://dke-qa.eu10.cp.iot.sap/
|EU |Productive |https://dke.eu1.cp.iot.sap/
|======================================================

== Using REST

Using REST, the message is sent as a single HTTP call using HTTPs and the endpoint certificates delivered with the onboarding Request.

=== Address

To send messages to the agrirouter, the app has to perform a POST request sending a message included in a Request.

Messages and commands are sent to the inbox. The address of the inbox is returned with the onboarding request ("measures") and should look like this:

[cols="1,4",options="header",]
|========================================================
|Method |Address
|POST |/iot/gateway/rest/measures/{\{deviceAlternateId\}}
|========================================================

=== Header

As the communication works via https, the SSL Certificate information delivered with the onboarding Result is needed.

In most communication libraries, the developer just has to provide

* the certificate, which is the public key,
* the SSLKey, which is the private key
* the password for the private key

Most libraries are than able to handle the communication.

For further information see the curl documentation on the parameters used for a communication. For curl_easy_setopt(:

* CURLOPT_SSLKEY
* CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD
* CURLOPT_SSLCERT

The header of the HTTP Request for the REST implementation also requires

Content-Type: "application/json"

or

Content-Type: "application/x-protobuf"

[NOTE]
====
Regardless which Content-Type you use, make sure that your implementation includes "application/json" in the "accept"-Parameter of the HTTP Call. 

The Inbox of agrirouter is not able to return protobuf and will return a status of 4xx if it can't find json in the accepted responses.
====


=== Body

The body consists of the message package that was created in the previous paragraphs.

== Receiving a Response

HTTP Messages always get confirmed by the agrirouter. For the HTTP REST Gateway, the agrirouter will simply send a HTTP Status between 200 and 299. For MQTT, there will not be any response.

== Header

The Header has a HTTP Status between 200 and 299.

== Body

The Body of the response is empty.

[NOTE]
====
The result code of this simply informs you if the endpoint was reachable and if the inbox was able to forward the message
