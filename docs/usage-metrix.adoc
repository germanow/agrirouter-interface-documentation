agrirouter collects and measures all information (event types) regarding data exchange in real time.

For each message transported through agrirouter, it includes the following parameters:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================================
|column |type |Comment
|id |UUID |The ID of the message
|dh_message_id |UUID |The agrirouter internal ID of this message
|account_id |UUID |The agrirouter account id, in which this message was sent
|endpoint_id |UUID |The endpoint ID of the endpoint, for which the event happened
|tech_msg_type_id |String |The technical message type of this message
|event_type |Enum |The current status of the message; see below
|volume |Integer |The total volume of the encoded message
|buffer_duration |Integater |How long did the message persist in the feed, until it was delivered or deleted
|month |Integer |
|day |Integer |
|hour |Integer |
|year |Integer |
|created_on |TimeStamp |When was this message delivered to the feed?
|===========================================================================================================

The event type is one of the following:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|========================================================================================
|Event |Description
|ACKNOWLEDGMENT |Acknowledgment created by agrirouter in response to message.
|CONFIRMED |Message was confirmed by specified endpoint.
|DELETED |Message was deleted by specified endpoint.
|DELIVERED |Message was delivered to specified endpoint (but not yet confirmed).
|ERROR |Message was returned because of an error (e. g. missing team context ID).
|OFFBOARDED |Message was deleted, because the specified endpoint was deleted / offboarded.
|SENT |Message was sent by specified endpoint.
|TIMEDOUT |Message was deleted because it timed out after 4 weeks.
|========================================================================================

Sent and Error mark events of the inbox, all the other events are events of feed or outbox.

The aggregated result will have the following structure:

[cols="1,1,2",options="header",]
|=========================================================================================================================
|column |type |Comment
|app_provider_id |uuid |derived from the endpoint ID
|app_id |uuid |derived from endpoint ID; this is the field over which the aggregate will be calculated
|account_id |uuid |taken directly from raw data
|endpoint_id |uuid |taken directly from raw data
|event_type |character varying(15) |taken directly from raw data; second field over which the aggregate will be calculated
|total_messages |integer |number of messages in aggregate
|total_volume |integer |total data volume in aggregate
|average_duration |integer |average buffer time of aggregate
|month |integer |
|day |integer |third key field over which the aggregate will be calculated
|hour |integer |
|year |integer |
|created_on |timestamp with time zone |
|=========================================================================================================================

In any agrirouter developer account (account management -> export metrics), these usage statistics can be exported for your applications.

**Update**
As the payment concept changed to a flat rate model per sending directions based on end user account. These statistics are relevant for the billing and they give you a good overview of how much communication per end user account really exists.
